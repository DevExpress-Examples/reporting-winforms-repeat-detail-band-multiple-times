# How to Repeat the Detail Band a Different Number of Times 


In this example a detail band bound to data produces several rows in a document for a single record. The number of rows is calculated at runtme and equals to the current value of another data field.

If a report is **not bound** to a data source (the data source is empty or undefined), the [ReportPrintOptions.DetailCountOnEmptyDataSource](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.ReportPrintOptions.DetailCountOnEmptyDataSource) property determines how many times the Detail band content is printed.
 
If a report is **bound to data**, you can **limit** the number of times the Detail band is printed with the [ReportPrintOptions.DetailCount](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.ReportPrintOptions.DetailCount) property. In other words, if a data source contains one record, the **DetailCount** property does not enable us to print the Detail band more than once.

This example demonstrates how to print the Detail band for a single record multiple times. The number of times to repeat the Detal band is aÂ value retrieved from another data field.Â The [DetailReportBand](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.DetailReportBand) is unbound, and the the [ReportPrintOptions.DetailCountOnEmptyDataSource](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.ReportPrintOptions.DetailCountOnEmptyDataSource) property is specified in the **DetailReportBand.BeforePrint** event handler.
